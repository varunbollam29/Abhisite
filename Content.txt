With over 15 years of experience in Learning and Organizational Dev across APAC, EMEA, India, and North America, I’ve had the chance to design and lead some exciting talent and leadership programs. From rolling out global L&D strategies at Franklin Templeton to building digital learning experiences at Cognizant, I’m all about making learning impactful—and fun. I’m passionate about inclusion, growth, and helping people tap in their full potential. Can’t wait to dive in, share what I’ve learned, and create something awesome together. Let’s make this journey a blast!

Assess and customize to your needs
No two organizations are the same and your people deserve more than one-size-fits-all solutions. I specialize in building tailored Learning & Development programs that reflect your company’s DNA. With 15+ years of global experience across APAC, EMEA, India, and North America, I’ll work with you to create learning journeys that align with your growth plans, values, and strategic goals ensuring your time and investment deliver real outcomes.

Offer you real-world instructional expertise
I’m not just a facilitator I’ve led enterprise L&D functions in organizations like Franklin Templeton, State Street, and Cognizant. Whether it’s digital learning, leadership development, or DEI programs, I bring hands-on, real-world expertise from industries including BFSI, IT, Healthcare, BPO, and KPO. My sessions are grounded in practical insights and focused on improving business performance.

Understanding your industry
Having managed cross-border teams and large-scale L&D initiatives, I stay plugged into your sector’s trends through constant engagement with industry advisors and business leaders. I understand the complexity of workforce transformation, and I’ll work closely with you to craft solutions that are not only relevant but transformative.
